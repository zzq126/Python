    "#### Question: Explain what a streaming framework is and how it works (150 words max).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. What streaming framework is:\n",
    "The Streaming APIs give developers low latency access to Twitter’s global stream of Tweet data. A proper implementation of a streaming client will be pushed messages indicating Tweets and other events have occurred, without any of the overhead associated with polling a REST endpoint.\n",
    "Twitter offers several streaming endpoints, each customized to certain use cases, such as public streams, user streams and site streams.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "#### b. How streaming works:\n",
    "* 1.Connect to a streaming endpoint:\n",
    "Establishing a connection to streaming APIs means making a very long lived HTTP request, and parsing the response incrementally. \n",
    "* 2.Set streaming API request parameters\n",
    "For example: delimited, stall_warnings, filter_level, language, follow, track, locations, count, with, replies, stringify_friend_id\n",
    "* 3.Set streaming API message types\n",
    "* 4.process streaming data\n",
